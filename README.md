# Intrinsify 

**Pitch/Idea:** For beginners, it can be very overwhelming when first investing. The ratios, technical indicators, cash flow, and all the technical jargon is a lot to learn. I have created a web application that allows users that are new to the investing space to search stocks and easily look at their intrinsic value. I have also added some summaries of some imporant metrics that all beginner investors should know. 

**MVP/Key Features:** 
* Discover stocks based on simple user search
* Create an account and secure login via Bcrypt
* Keep track of stocks you want, with your own watchlist (Add and Delete)
* Text updates to desired phone number through Twilio API.

**Database**
* A table for user information
* A table for watchlist that were added by a specific user

* Users will be able to create discussion boards to talk more in depth about stocks with other users

**Searching a Stock**
