# Intrinsify 

**Pitch/Idea:** Create a web application that allows users to search stocks and save/delete it to their watchlist. I hope to add relevant information about the stock and also utilize intrinsic formulas to show whether a stock is a good buy or not. 

**MVP/Key Features:** 
* Discover stocks based on simple user search
* Create an account and secure login via Bcrypt
* Keep track of stocks you want, with your own watchlist (Add and Delete)
* Compare stock prices and intrinsic values

**Database**
* A table for user information
* A table for watchlist that were added by a specific user

**Future Features**
* Users will be alerted via text through Twilio API if a stock reaches a certain desired price
* Users will be able to create discussion boards to talk more in depth about stocks with other users
